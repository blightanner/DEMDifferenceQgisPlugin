description=Calculates the difference in volume between two raster layers
version=0.1
author=L Yang/Bligh Tanner

about=Calculates the volume difference between two raster layers with elevation data. If the layers are different sizes, the larger will be clipped to the smaller. Units of the raster/DEM must match project units (eg, m, m^2, m^3).  To view the volume difference between raster surfaces, open the statistical summary pane (View->Statistical Summary), select the generated statistical summary layer (zonalStats<*>) and select the "Volume" field.  The difference in volume is the calculated "Sum" statistic.  A negative number implies erosion/loss, a positive number implies accretion/gain.
